# Trello Clone - Fullstack Project
## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a fullstack Trello clone built with modern web technologies, designed to replicate the core functionality of Trello, a popular project management tool. The application allows users to:

Create, edit, and organize boards (for different projects)

Add lists (like "To Do," "In Progress," "Done")

Manage cards (tasks) with drag-and-drop functionality

Collaborate with team members (if multi-user features are implemented)

The project follows best practices in frontend and backend development, ensuring a scalable, responsive, and user-friendly experience.
